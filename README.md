## Changes That I Made

- Added the **Blog Section**.
- Included **dates** and descriptive **text** for each blog post.
- it's now responsive on all devices.

## What Needs to Be Changed

1. **Date Accuracy**: 
   - Dates are placeholders and need to be updated with the correct values.

2. **Button Behavior (PC)**: 
   - When pressing the "Read More" button on one blog post, all other posts also expand. This needs to be fixed to ensure only the clicked post expands.

3. **Image Adjustments**: 
   - Images need better alignment for a better appearance.
  
4. **General CSS Adjustments**: 
   - The button needs to be aligned with each other on PC.
   - and other small things
